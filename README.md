# Banking-Application-using-sprint-boot-microservices
The Banking Application is built using a microservices architecture, incorporating the Spring Boot framework along with other Spring technologies such as Spring Data JPA, Spring Cloud, and Spring Security, alongside tools like Maven for dependency management. These technologies play a crucial role in establishing essential components like Service Registry, API Gateway, and more.

Moreover, they enable us to develop independent microservices such as the user service for user management, the account service for account generation and other related functionalities, the fund transfer service for various transfer operations, and the transaction service for viewing transactions and facilitating withdrawals and deposits. These technologies not only streamline development but also enhance scalability and maintainability, ensuring a robust and efficient banking system.
